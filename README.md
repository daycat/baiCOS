Special thanks to: 鹿乃ちゃんの猫

## How to use:

### Setup:

Go to [here](https://pan.baidu.com/union/home) to register your account for BaiduNetdisk's development platform.

Then, register a new app:

![registerapp](https://proxy.freecdn.workers.dev?url=https://github.com/daycat/baiCOS/raw/main/images/baidudevcreateapp.png)

You will then see this screen: 

![appdetails](https://proxy.freecdn.workers.dev?url=https://github.com/daycat/baiCOS/raw/main/images/appdetails.png)

Download the whole repo [here](https://proxy.freecdn.workers.dev?url=https://github.com/daycat/baiCOS/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
And using your editor of choice, change the appKey and secretKey variables to your own:
![mainpy1](https://proxy.freecdn.workers.dev?url=https://github.com/daycat/baiCOS/raw/main/images/mainpy1.png)
Then, modify the client_id in the url to your own:
![mainpy2](https://proxy.freecdn.workers.dev?url=https://github.com/daycat/baiCOS/raw/main/images/mainpy2.png)

> You must use your own appID and secret, unless you want to show me what you have in your drive!!!

You can now run the program.

### Privacy

All the source code is open on github (here)[https://github.com/daycat/baiCOS] for review. All your data is securely passed through your computer and Baidu, so therefore, I will not be able to see what you use this program for.

### Next:
1. Upload function
2. Better login method
3. Deployable server for renewing file links
